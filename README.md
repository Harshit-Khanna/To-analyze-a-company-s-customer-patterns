## Project: To analyze a company's customer patterns
**Problem:** To help a company decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website 
<br /> The Ecommerce company is based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have an in-store style and clothing advice sessions. 
Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
<br /> **Solution:** A linear regression model which helps a company decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
